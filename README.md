# ExcelJS

[![Tests](https://github.com/hyperliskdev/exceljs/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/hyperliskdev/exceljs/actions/workflows/tests.yml)


This project was forked from [ExcelJS](https://github.com/exceljs/exceljs). After using some of the functions with ExcelJS, I found some problems with how things were being rendered. To improve this project, I plan to use the [ECMA-376](https://ecma-international.org/publications-and-standards/standards/ecma-376/) standard to include as many of the important XML definitions.

# Installation

```shell
npm install @hyperliskdev/exceljs
```
